New Scenario:

Malaysia is known for its tourism in social media especially the beautiful islands with clear water and rich aquatic ecosystem

As such, a lot of tourists from around the world is fond of scuba diving at the infamous Redang Island.

Currently, there is only 1 bridge at the beach of Redang Island which lead tourists to the scuba diving spot.

The bridge can have a maximum capacity of 3 tourists at the same time.

Due to the conservation acts of coral reefs at Redang Island, only 1 tourist can scuba dive at that spot at the same time

Currently, there are 5 tourists wanting to scuba dive and waiting at the beach.

How can we propose a solution to solve this efficiently?

Solution Planning:

Assuming the 5 tourists are:
--> Tourist 1
--> Tourist 2
--> Tourist 3
--> Tourist 4
--> Tourist 5

Assuming bridge acts as the semaphore:
--> Only allowing 3 tourists on the bridge at one time

Assuming scuba diving acts as the mutex:
--> Only allowing 1 tourist to dive at one time
