Scenario:

It is the year 2024
XMB is a well-knowed university in Bangi. It is currently recruiting for 1 student.

XMB's campus has 1 dorm room for students, a single person dorm.
The single person dorm can accomodate only 1 person at the same time.

Each XMB student must stay in campus to proceed with their studies.
During the period of not staying in the dorm, studies are halted and can only resume after staying back in dorm.

Student A is a new student in XMB and stayed at the single person dorm.
Student A is required to stay at this dorm for the 4 year of his study which he is now only a year 1 student.

At the year 2025, the school suddenly annouced to carry out renovation plans to accomodate more students in campus
By the school's new policy, the plan is set to renovate the single person dorm into a double person dorm.

The double person dorm can accomodate 2 person at the same time.

During the 1 year renovation, student originally staying in the dorm will be temporarily moved and wait until renovation has completed.
Student A will be received a notice that the room should be evacuated or he will be evicted.

But due to the local law, student A cannot be randomly evicted and renovation must wait until student A completed his studies.

Now at the same time, there are 2 new students at the XMB office which are student B and student C.
Student B and C must stay in the campus in order to complete their 4 year bachelor's degree studies. 

Currently, student A has 3 year remaining in studies. Student B and C has 4 year remaining in studies.

How can we propose a solution to solve this efficiently, so that 3 students can finish their studies and the renovation can carry out?

Solution Planning:

Assuming student A, B, C and repair team as 4 threads:
--> Student A: thread_A
--> Student B: thread_B
--> Student C: thread_C
--> Repair team: thread_4

Assuming the dorm space as a resource:
--> Before renovation: Only allow single student (Mutex)
--> During renovation: Only allow thread_repair (Mutex)
--> After renovation: Allow 2 students at the same time (Semaphore)

Steps:

--> Create global mutex
--> Create global semaphore

--> Create global data of current year

--> Create 2 functions
    -> Single dorm (using mutex, only for student A and repair team)
        > Lock mutex
        > Increase current year
        > Decrease thread data by 1
        > Print current year and information of thread
        > Unlock mutex

    -> Double dorm (using semaphores, for all students, allowed 2 student same time)
        > Sem wait
        > Increase current year
        > Decrease thread data by 1
        > Print current year and information of thread
        > Sem post

--> Create 4 threads which represent A, B, C, repair

--> In main function:
    -> Create data of 3 students representing their current year of study
        > Student A = 3 years
        > Student B = 4 years
        > Student C = 4 years
    
    -> Create data of repair team representing no. years required to complete renovation
        > 1 year

    -> Initialize mutex

    -> Create thread_A (single_dorm)
    -> Create thread_4 (single_dorm)

    -> thread_A join 
    -> thread_4 join

    -> Destroy mutex

    -> Initialize semaphore

    -> Create thread_B (double_dorm)
    -> Create thread_C (double_dorm)

    -> thread_B join
    -> thread_C join

    -> Destroy semaphore
